        <h1>Welcome to the simplestyle_purple template</h1>
        <p>Complete this course by building a personal website
It's very common for developers to have their own personal website. One that is built from scratch, without using templates, and one that showcases a developer's style.

If you haven't built one yet, consider this your time to make one.

To complete this course: Create and host a website of your own, host it using Github Pages, and include the martial arts sim that you've built in this level as one of your projects.

Once you've hosted it online, share its link with us.

What you need to do
Using what you've learned, create a personal website of your own. You can put anything you want inside of it, as long as you...

...include a separate Projects page that includes the martial arts simulator that you've built in this level. This means a fully functional martial arts simulator that includes the animation system that we built in this level.

Host your website on Github pages, and share the link to a hosted version of your website.

Please ensure that...
...your website is live, and accessible.
...your website includes a link to a separate Projects (or similar) page that includes the martial arts sim. Do not put your martial arts sim on the index page; put it on a separate page, and then link to it.
...the martial arts sim on your website should be functional.
We'll take a look at your site, and tell you what we think of it - no bot (automated) reviews here - just other developers looking at your work and sharing some comments.

Use Github Pages to host your website
For this final assignment, we require that you use Github Pages.

Go through the link above, and follow their instructions to learn how you can host a website (for free) using Github.

Don't have a Github account?
If you haven't used Github before, sign up now. Github is the world's leading code hosting platform, and is used almost universally by developers for sharing their code and to collaborate on larger projects.

Start by signing up for a Github account (it's free!).
Go through Github's Hello World Guide - it'll teach you all the basics on how to get started with sharing your code online.
After you submit your work here
This part is optional, but we recommend that you show off your customized project by sharing its link on the Discord community. Tell everyone what you learned, what worked, and what didn't.

Thank you!
Thank you for going through this course!

If you have any comments, please leave them as a part of your submission. We'd appreciate any kind of feedback - whether it's criticism, suggestions for improvement, or whatever else you'd like to say.

We hope you've enjoyed your time here, and wish you the best in your learning journey.</p>
